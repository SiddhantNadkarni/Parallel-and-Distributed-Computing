This repositary contains programming assignments completed as a part of the course EE 451 - Parallel and Distributed computing under Prof. Viktor Prasanna in Fall 2019.

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites

All Homeworks are written in C++11, compiler used: g++ (latest version)

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
